## Description

![Logo FishEye](https://github.com/Roy-Framery-s-Openclassrooms-projects/RoyFramery_6_10082021/tree/main/public/images/README/logo.png)

__*FishEye*__ is the sixth project I made during this training. 
Since few weeks I'm a junior developer at Techasite, 
a consulting company specialised in website and mobile application development.
The goal üéØ was to build a **working prototype** of a new website in **HTML, CSS and JavaScript**.
For this, I had a [briefing](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/course.oc-static.com/projects/Front-End+V2/P5+Javascript+%26+Accessibility/Notes+de+r%C3%A9union.pdf) that notice me some features and contraints to integrate, 
the [mockup](https://www.figma.com/file/pt8xJxC1QffW4HX16QhGZJ/UI-Design-FishEye-FR?node-id=0%3A1)
and [data](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/course.oc-static.com/projects/Front-End+V2/P5+Javascript+%26+Accessibility/FishEyeData.json) in **Json** format: 

### About the briefing :
- **Home page** :
  - I had to **display** a list of photographers with their **name, tagline, localisation, dailyprice, tafs and a thumbnail**
  - By **clicking** of one of the tags in the header, the list of photographers is **filtered** to show only those that **match this tags**
  - When the user **clicks** on a photographer's thumbnail, they are **taken to their page**.
- **Photographers' pages** :
  - **Displays** a gallery of the **photographer's work**
  - Photographers can show both **photos** and **videos**
    - I had to **use Fattory Pattern** for create a video or an image
    - In the **case** of videos, show a **thumbnail** in the gallery
  - **Each** media item includes a **title and a number of likes**
    - When the user **clicks** on the "Like" icon, the number of likes displayed **is incremented**
    - A photographer's **total number of likes** should **equal** the **sum of the likes** of each of his media
  - **Media** can be **sorted by popularity or by title and date**
  - When the user **clicks** on a media, it should **open in a lightbox** :
    - When the lightbox is displayed, there is a **cross in the corner to close the window**
    - There are **navigation buttons** to move from one media item to another (users can **click** on these buttons **to navigate**).
    - **Arrow keys** are also used **to navigate** between media
  - Display **a button to contact the photographer**
    - The contact form **is a modal** that is displayed **over the rest**
    - It includes fields for **name, email address and message**
    - Later, the contact button will send a message to the photographer. For now, only **display** the contents of the three fields in the **console logs**

### Accessibility 
A big point was made on the accessibility :
- Use **"semantic"** HTML elements that describe their intent **as much as** possible, **instead of** putting <div> and <span> elements everywhere.
- When you need to create a **custom element**, add **ARIA attributes** to describe what it does.
- The code should **pass the AChecker tests without a known issue**.
- Use a free **screen reader** to get an idea of how much using the site for a visually impaired person: I used **NVDA**.


### Mockup 
I would found in the [mockup](https://www.figma.com/file/pt8xJxC1QffW4HX16QhGZJ/UI-Design-FishEye-FR?node-id=0%3A1) a lot of details about **fonts, colors, element's size, hover effect, etc.**
